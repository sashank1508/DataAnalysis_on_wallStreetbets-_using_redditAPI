wallstreetbets,preearnings calls on ingr ingredion,i bought ingr c this morning to profit from an expected runup in iv and delta prior to earnings being released on im using the same analysis that i used for adsk return gtlb return cost return pgr return and cat return you can see deets on those in my post history first heres what my model predicts it says a fair value right now for the contracts is about i got mine for a monte carlo simulation based on the underlying stocks historical behavior in the days leading up to earnings and atm contract iv runup suggests the option should on average rise in value over the next days the upper red line is the percentile the blue line is the mean and the lower lines are the and respectively based on fundamentals i think well see the stock rise over the next days because ingr always beats eps estimates so as forecasts start getting dialed in over the next few weeks buying should pick up the company has an internal initiative called costcompete started last year where theyre driving down costs as they predicted this year sale revenue is down but because of costcompete their costs are down lower and so profit is up yoy they are targeting m in cost savings by end of and are at m currently they didnt revise that m number so i expect to see higher savings this quarter than last meaning even higher profitability they withstood inflation and high rates just fine and their forex impacts were a wash so far this year so as inflation drops sales should pick up combined with reduced costs they should show excellent earnings and i think the market will foresee that their guidance for this coming quarter is still conservative and was made prerate cuts and inflation reports so sales might already be up ill be looking to close this one around depending on how iv goes over the next week or two,0.88,6,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1g0ktro/preearnings_calls_on_ingr_ingredion/,0.8679,positive,,"['bought', 'ingr', 'c', 'morning', 'profit', 'expected', 'runup', 'iv', 'delta', 'prior', 'earnings', 'released', 'im', 'using', 'analysis', 'used', 'adsk', 'return', 'gtlb', 'return', 'cost', 'return', 'pgr', 'return', 'cat', 'return', 'see', 'deets', 'post', 'history', 'first', 'heres', 'model', 'predicts', 'says', 'fair', 'value', 'right', 'contracts', 'got', 'mine', 'monte', 'carlo', 'simulation', 'based', 'underlying', 'stocks', 'historical', 'behavior', 'days', 'leading', 'earnings', 'atm', 'contract', 'iv', 'runup', 'suggests', 'option', 'average', 'rise', 'value', 'next', 'days', 'upper', 'red', 'line', 'percentile', 'blue', 'line', 'mean', 'lower', 'lines', 'respectively', 'based', 'fundamentals', 'think', 'well', 'see', 'stock', 'rise', 'next', 'days', 'ingr', 'always', 'beats', 'eps', 'estimates', 'forecasts', 'start', 'getting', 'dialed', 'next', 'weeks', 'buying', 'pick', 'company', 'internal', 'initiative', 'called', 'costcompete', 'started', 'last', 'year', 'theyre', 'driving', 'costs', 'predicted', 'year', 'sale', 'revenue', 'costcompete', 'costs', 'lower', 'profit', 'yoy', 'targeting', 'cost', 'savings', 'end', 'currently', 'didnt', 'revise', 'number', 'expect', 'see', 'higher', 'savings', 'quarter', 'last', 'meaning', 'even', 'higher', 'profitability', 'withstood', 'inflation', 'high', 'rates', 'fine', 'forex', 'impacts', 'wash', 'far', 'year', 'inflation', 'drops', 'sales', 'pick', 'combined', 'reduced', 'costs', 'show', 'excellent', 'earnings', 'think', 'market', 'foresee', 'guidance', 'coming', 'quarter', 'still', 'conservative', 'made', 'prerate', 'cuts', 'inflation', 'reports', 'sales', 'might', 'already', 'ill', 'looking', 'close', 'one', 'around', 'depending', 'iv', 'goes', 'next', 'week', 'two']"

wallstreetbets,when will investor delusion end,im new please dont bully me i have no clue what is going on which is why i use really basic concepts in my explanation growth investment vs value investment one one hand there are growth stocks wall street currently is in overdrive investors are hyperoptimistic and companies like tickers tsmc and nvda are trading far above their average pe ratios these types of companies are called growth stocks because investors are betting that in the future their valuations will be justified by nvdas performance instead of investing in intrinsic value shareholders are investing in the implicit value of a company which is what they perceive the future intrinsic value of a company will be when the economy is doing well as it is now kinda i think growth stocks do well this is because demand for goods and services goes up interest rates go down revenues for businesses go up borrowing is cheaper and technology companies like nvda can capitalize off of that to fund rampd growing the scale of operations and benefitting from economies of scale justifying the implicit valuations raising stock prices to the stratosphere on the other hand when the economy is receding as part of its natural cycle the economy gets a reality check investors realize that their growth valuations were too optimistic and that their predictions wont mature soon enough to achieve their desired roi per annum as a result they flock to value investments because they realize that companies like bank of america are resilient undervalued and going to grow in a highinterest environment which we could be looking at in december the same thing happens in a bubble and it is no secret that ai is a bubble as of now considering the ludicrous difference in implicit and intrinsic valuations looking at nvda it is easy to see how we could be looking at the first half of a repeat of the d printing bubble in that is not to say that d printing is akin to ai however it is almost guaranteed that nvda fill be facing a significant correction like aapl did in december and december after a rally due to the incoming cpi data unlike aapl we are too late to invest in growth stocks and too early to buy value stocks so we are faced with a dilemma how can we invest on the tipping point of the economys growth to be honest i have no fucking clue however with cpi data coming et that could change if cpi is significantly higher than before a world of high interest rate december will become much more visible if it is significantly lower then we will see a big rally for companies like nvda anything in between a clearcut cpi will just muddy the waters as the stock market is rife with ai speculative delusion what is certain however is that nvda sooner or later will get a really painful reality check and if you dont believe me you shouldnt because i dont know what im yapping about what is going to happen are my puts

prior generations as a base and add to it so its no surprise that an nba player from would look like krusty the clown on a modern nba team well guess what same shit has happened in investing amp trading and on an even bigger scale the stakes are much higher instead of your high school star athlete making the big leagues were talking about the most powerful companies in the world making superyacht money the amount of resources devoted to solving markets is astronomical so now we have a different landscape from your dads stupid tech company in yeah they were cute firing up their shitty computers and randomly pressing some buttons in a suit amp tie investors were onto something back in the s tech bubble though they realized the trick to investing front run everything yeah bitch front run fucking everything radio on the internet fuck it heres a billion dollars petscom sure you get m yeah they took it a little too far in the s but guess what they were right the internet was the future and the right early bets on internet companies made you wildly rich the reality was that you could be wrong on picks so long as you had the amazon microsoft apple plus since people werent front running as much back then you didnt need to drop x pricesales on most of these picks pre so who the fuck cares if you bought petscom broadcastcom your dads shitty tech startup so long as you just accidentally bought one of the fucking juggernauts all mistakes were easily forgiven so yeah today we are thinking damn everything is so expensive ai is a bubble but guess what thats just boomer talk from now on everything that has a remote chance at being successful is gonna be front run to shit you can forget about getting in at the bottom floor once an industry even hints that it will make a splash some bastards are going to buy the shit out of it the days where your dumb ass is gonna find tesla at or nvda at are long gone buddy so thanks for coming to my ted talk stop crying

wallstreetbets,years ago today,on september the fed made a bps rate cut greater than expected despite reasonably good economic data markets rallied for about weeks and spx closed at an alltime high on october which would not be matched again until march in recovery from the great financial crisis on september the fed made a bps rate cut greater than expected despite reasonably good economic data markets rallied for about weeks and spx closed at an alltime high today october this is not financial advice nearly as much as it is anecdotal evidence that we live in the matrix other thoughts the sahm rule stood at only bps as of the unemployment reading of september as opposed to bps in september albeit unemployment was generally higher right around between late additionally the parttime gig economy is massive today compared to but bls still counts that as not unemployed the vix was hovering between during the october market peak compared to today yearoveryear cpi change from december to december was so inflation was not dead when the fed started their easing cycle the bond market is implying a similar problem in todays economy with increasing us treasury yields although current yoy cpi readings are generally lower today than in unlike this is an election year and i operate under the assumption that all current bls statistics are not just cooked but deep fried edit going to try to address some of the repeated comments im seeing here past performance doesnt guarantee future results of course the main point of this post was to highlight the similarities in timelines between today and years ago our economic situation is massively different although id argue still weak but theres no subprime crisis right probably not however we still have skyrocketing consumer credit defaults paired with an abysmally low personal savings rate additionally we have something along the lines of trillion cre loans with balloon payments or adjustable rates kicking in within the next months on a bunch of loans that are underwater with their respective banks and many of which have been collateralized into clos and sold both domestically and internationally i still think there will be some blood in the water additionally the median house price to median income ratio is higher today than it was at its absolute peak so id still argue that real estate has been overspeculated the government wont let the market crash during an election year probably not in fact theres a very real scenario where the fed steps in with hyperqe if things hit the fan congress is scheduled to meet in january to negotiate the current us debt ceiling and the us frankly cant afford a recession right now they need those tax dollars hyperinflation to erode the real value of the us debt and prop up the markets is highly plausible imo dumb ber dumb bol positions or ban im short term bullish on bonds tlt just bounced off its sma twice and i wouldnt be surprised to see investors eat up those nice high yields if earnings season goes sour i have figures on tlt calls expiring postelection im gonna wait on spx plays until the election is over tldr the fed cut rates on the exact same date in as and spx
